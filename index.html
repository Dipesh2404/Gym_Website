            <p class="sectionSubTag SectionSmall">This workout will alternate between strength training movements
                utilizing the Curves equipment and four different conditioning movements. There will be one movement
                from each of the class categories, Balance, Body Basics, Boxing, and Cardio to help increase your core
                strength, balance agility, and coordination. Repeating the same workout throughout the week will allow
                you to gain confidence and familiarity with the movements which help you work harder and see greater
                results.

            <p class="sectionSubTag SectionSmall">Chest day can get old fast if you just stick to the same old barbell
                bench press-centric routine. Mix up your regimen â€” and push your core to perform.
                You'll need access to dumbbells, adjustable benches, and a cable machine, so you're probably only going
                to be able to do this workout in a gym. You definitely won't need a barbell bench, though, so get ready
                to power through these moves in the time you'd usually be stuck waiting for your turn on the gym's most
                popular real estate.

            <p class="sectionSubTag SectionSmall">When it comes down to it you want to focus on the mind-muscle
                connection. You should really feel each rep and feel the muscle working. If you don't feel an exercise
                in your biceps, then you are probably doing it wrong or are using a weight that you can't handle and are
                using more than just your biceps.
                Most of all have fun with your workouts. If you aren't having fun, then what's the point? Utilize what
                you learned in this course and see where it takes you. Good luck and see you at graduation!
